# BARK | NFT Staking UI

This repository contains the UI interface that powers NFT staking on the Solana blockchain via [staking.barktoken.app](https://staking.barktoken.app/nft/). You can use this UI to create and deploy stake pools with built-in reward distribution, or to build your own custom interface using our underlying staking protocol.

## Pool Creation Parameters

When creating a stake pool, you can configure the following parameters:

```typescript
export type StakePoolParams {
    allowedCollections?: PublicKey[];
    allowedCreators?: PublicKey[];
    requiresAuthorization?: boolean;
    overlayText?: string;
    imageUri?: string;
    resetOnStake?: boolean;
  }
```

- **allowedCollections**: Specify an array of NFT collection `PublicKey`s that are allowed in this pool.
- **allowedCreators**: Specify an array of NFT creator `PublicKey`s that are allowed in this pool.
- **requiresAuthorization**: Set to `true` if staking in this pool requires authorization.
- **overlayText**: Text overlay for the pool, often used for display purposes.
- **imageUri**: URI for an image to visually represent the pool.
- **resetOnStake**: Set to `true` if the staking process should reset the NFTâ€™s state.

## Reward Distribution Parameters

When configuring reward distribution, you can use the following parameters:

```typescript
export type RewardDistributionParams {
    stakePoolId: PublicKey;
    rewardMintId: PublicKey;
    rewardAmount?: BN;
    rewardDurationSeconds?: BN;
    kind?: RewardDistributorKind;
    maxSupply?: BN;
    supply?: BN;
  }
```

- **stakePoolId**: The `PublicKey` of the stake pool that will distribute rewards.
- **rewardMintId**: The `PublicKey` of the token mint used for rewards.
- **rewardAmount**: Optional. The amount of tokens to be rewarded.
- **rewardDurationSeconds**: Optional. Duration (in seconds) for which the reward will be distributed.
- **kind**: The type of reward distribution, either `Mint` or `Treasury`.
- **maxSupply**: Optional. The maximum supply of rewards that can be distributed.
- **supply**: Optional. The current supply of rewards available.

### Reward Distribution Types

There are two types of reward distribution (`RewardDistributionKind`) available:

1. **Mint**: Grants the mint authority of your reward token to the stake pool, allowing it to mint tokens on demand.
2. **Treasury**: Transfers reward tokens from your wallet to the stake pool. You will need to top up the stake pool treasury as needed.

## Environments

The staking program and related UIs are deployed on both the Solana mainnet-beta and devnet environments. By default, the UI points to mainnet. 

To switch to devnet, append `?cluster=devnet` to the URL. All configurations, including pools, reward distributors, tokens, NFTs, and SOL, are environment-specific. No data will be carried over between mainnet and devnet.
